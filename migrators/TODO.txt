- Create separate configuration for source and binary migrations (creating maybe named configuration such as
module-source, module-binary so that we can also use the migrators on other projects than just modules)
- Move as much as possible of the existing transformations out of the Jahia url war project and into the migrators
(including the unit tests)
- Implement move
- Improve Javadocs
